This basic mockup is my first attempt at making a game. It's written in
Lua, and uses the Love framework.

It is playable, in the sence that you can navigate a character in the game,
get artifacts that give you abilities and such, but there is no piont to it.
No story, no enemies, nothing.

To get started, you need to get the Love framework from love2d.org. Download
this repo as a zip file, change the extension to ".love". If you need help
on getting started, you can find that here:

If you find it useful, feel free to use it.

draw if my life depended on it.
